Description of Project

overall layout:
-I left container centered since it looked better

Index:
-In the navbar, I added the justify-content-end to move the three tabs for contact, portofolio and about. 
-added a margin so that the background would have space around like in pictures.
-Used "pull-left" to wrap text around picture. 

Contact Page:
-I used a bootstrap form that I edited to be reflective of the required form.
-I used the same elements/basic layout as the index page. 
-Weird ... icon?

Portfolio Page:
-Used mx-auto to center the photos and added padding in css to get the appriorate space between and then used two column sizes so that when the screen reduced there would only be one picture. 
-utlized row and columns to acheive the appriorate layout
-left one row blank to have 5 images and one off centered.
